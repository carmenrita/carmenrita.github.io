      To celebrate the birth of this webpage, I have learned the basics of HTML. On September 18 of 2019 I created the most basic webpage. I now know how to change color and add padding. I can also add images of Yoda.

        <p class="orangeredtext">
          On the second class of html and css, I learned about changing type. I also leaned how to apply a class and an id. This is why this text is orange and the one up top is maroon. :)
